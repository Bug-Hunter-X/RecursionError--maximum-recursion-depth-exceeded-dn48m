# RecursionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`.  The error occurs when a recursive function calls itself too many times, exceeding the Python interpreter's recursion limit.

The `bug.py` file contains code that will trigger this error. The `bugSolution.py` shows how to solve this, using iteration instead of recursion.
